# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: I believe that git is a type of terminal platform or source that is command driven and functions as a local driver to retrieve, return, and commit files and data to and from the Github website portal.  Git also has a built in command source that allows for local commands and functions.  GitHub would be the website where the user can access their account in order to utlize the repository features in Github to create, store, retrieve, merge, and share files and data.  GitHub also tracks and has more user functionality to increase portfolio performance, credetials, and shared access to work together as an open source. Git and Github are not the same and work independently of each other.

  Researched answer: Git is a free, open-source version control system designed to manage all source code history.  It is a DevOps tool.  Git operates locally on a system, so developers can manage their source code history using their local machine as repositories. Git is command driven and not GUI. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers. Its goals are speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Github is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories.  It allows developers to share their repositories, access other developers' respositories, and store remote copies of repositories to serve as backups.  Github lives in the cloud, requires access, has a built-in management system and a proprietary GUI desktop. Github is focused on centralized source code hosting. Git can be used without Github, but Github cannot be used without Git. Both are owned by different companies.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Truthy and Falsey values, relational operators, loose equality, strict equality, and, or, null, undefined

  Researched answer: True, False, Relational operators, Loose equality, Strict equality, Logical operators, negation or bang operator, Null, Symbol, Undefined, NaN



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: index is the location of a string character and the placement value, beginning with a zero placement count, of where that character is. In an array the index is the place of the value within the array set, beginning with a zero placement count.  A value is the element that is defined, whether is be a number, "string" or what is being declared.

  Researched answer: Each element in the array must be a JavaScript type. The content of each element is called the value. Every value in an array has a particular location known as the index.  Indexes are sequental numbers thar are a bit like an address for every element in ther array.  Arrays are zero indexed.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: functions, operators, and methods that are already designed to function a specific way within the JavaScript code. Built-in methods are designed to function with specific data types, so they may not perform if used with the wrong data type.

  Researched answer: Is a small piece of functionality that has been added to the language to accomplish a common task.  Some methods will require addtional information to perform the action intended.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: two people performing different roles in order to collaborate, utilize different strengths and knowledge, balancing time and switching roles within designated time limits in order to perform tasks, catch mistakes, identify solutions, improve skills, and identify better research methods to build and develop better coding techniques and communication skills.  Paired programming involves a "driver" and a "navigator".  Only the driver should share their screen and work on the input portion of the coding task or project.  The navigator should assist in research, give appropriate input, feedback, and coding corrections, identify mistakes and provide good editing techniques while the driver is working on the code.  Both should openly communicate, respect each others ideas and be whiling to perform requests even if the coding does not work.  This gives everyone the opportunity to learn and see what works best or can improve the code.  The paired programmers should utilize a timer in order to switch roles in order to have another perspective and view of the project from both situations.  Taking breaks helps to realign focus, effort, and proper team working posture.

  Researched answer: Two people collaborating on one code source to collectivly produce one program. It uses different knowledge and strength and leads to better problem solving solutions.  It distributes the cognitive load, while not being tempted to take short-cuts or being distracted.  It helps in coding communication and better coding practice while talking through problems. The roles of the "driver" is to use the keyboard and mouse and managing the editor.  While the "navigator" is watching, advising, and thinking.  The "navigator" is responsible for higher-level input to the code as well as catching errors, bugs, and typos. Some techniques include switching roles every 10 - 25 minutes or using the Pomodoro method.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: For me, the most helpful thing this week was based on three things: 
  1. Lectures - I find the lectures to be paced very well and contructed in a way that is enjoyable to follow, because the instructors are applying the notes within the code editor, allowing the students to takes notes during the lecture, and then posting the lecture notes and video to the Learn Github repository.
  
  2. Watching the instructor perform the processes being taught and allowing the students to ask more about the processes and to see how other inputs effect the code and response outputs. 

  3. Working on the challenges in pair programming groups to repeat the taught techniques to build confidence, experience hands on learning, and improve development.

  I feel like I am more involved and engaged to learn when I am using more than one sense in the learning process.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: the process of creating specific code processes as many times as necessary to reach the required condition output.

2. Higher Order Functions: a function that can operate on other functions, being used as arguments,return a required result, return functions as their result.

3. Jest: a JavaScript testing framework used to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

4. Objects: a standalone entity, with properties and type. They are collections of key:value pairs.  They can contain functions as well as be single indexes of an array. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.

5. Classes: Are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes are a particular type of function. They have their own scope and contain data and behavior.
